## Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight pattern conserves memory by sharing large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. Shared flyweight objects are immutable, that is, they cannot be changed as they represent the characteristics that are shared with other objects.

In this pattern we have two model state:

### intrinsic state : 
constance data that cannot be changed by other objects and can only be seen when stored inside a `flyweight` object.

### extrinsic state :
Data that can be modified by other objects and stored in context.

> You will find flyweights mostly in utility type applications such as word processors, graphics programs, and network apps
```javascript
function Flyweight(make, model, processor) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.processor = processor;
};

const FlyWeightFactory = (function () {
    let flyweights = {};

    return {

        get: function (make, model, processor) {
            if (!flyweights[make + model]) {
                flyweights[make + model] =
                    new Flyweight(make, model, processor);
            }
            return flyweights[make + model];
        },

        getCount: function () {
            var count = 0;
            for (var f in flyweights) count++;
            return count;
        }
    }
})();

function ComputerCollection() {
    let computers = {};
    let count = 0;

    return {
        add: function (make, model, processor, memory, tag) {
            computers[tag] =
                new Computer(make, model, processor, memory, tag);
            count++;
        },

        get: function (tag) {
            return computers[tag];
        },

        getCount: function () {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

let Computer = function (make, model, processor, memory, tag) {
    this.flyweight = FlyWeightFactory.get(make, model, processor);
    this.memory = memory;
    this.tag = tag;
    this.getMake = function () {
        return this.flyweight.make;
    }
    // ...
}

function run() {
    let computers = new ComputerCollection();

    computers.add("Dell", "Studio XPS", "Intel", "5G", "Y755P");
    computers.add("Dell", "Studio XPS", "Intel", "6G", "X997T");
    computers.add("Dell", "Studio XPS", "Intel", "2G", "U8U80");
    computers.add("Dell", "Studio XPS", "Intel", "2G", "NT777");
    computers.add("Dell", "Studio XPS", "Intel", "2G", "0J88A");
    computers.add("HP", "Envy", "Intel", "4G", "CNU883701");
    computers.add("HP", "Envy", "Intel", "2G", "TXU003283");

    console.log("Computers: " + computers.getCount());
    console.log("Flyweights: " + FlyWeightFactory.getCount());
}

```

```
Output: 

Computers: 7
Flyweights: 2
```
